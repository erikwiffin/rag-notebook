# A Basic RAG

In this post, I describe the basic scaffolding that all my future work will build on top of. I built a simple question and answer application that uses a library of PDFs as a knowledge source. Along the way, I tried to make as few decisions as possible, relying on defaults or recommended settings in tutorials. It works pretty well! but we can do better. 

## Follow along at home

Since this is the scaffolding that all future work will build on, it lives in the [main branch](https://github.com/erikwiffin/rag-playground) of this project.
