# RAG Playground

This is a project where I will explore one of the fundamental building blocks of a modern AI-powered application, [Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) or RAG.

I'll be building out several different RAG implementations from scratch and documenting my learnings and choices along the way.

* [A basic, naive RAG implementation](2024/12/08/a-basic-rag) In this post, I describe the basic scaffolding that all my future work will build on top of. I built a simple question and answer application that uses a library of PDFs as a knowledge source. Along the way, I tried to make as few decisions as possible, relying on defaults or recommended settings in tutorials. It works pretty well! but we can do better.
